{"name":"Gettext","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gettext.git","body":"This is the GNU gettext package.  It is interesting for authors or\r\nmaintainers of other packages or programs which they want to see\r\ninternationalized.  As one step the handling of messages in different\r\nlanguages should be implemented.  For this task GNU gettext provides\r\nthe needed tools and library functions.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting for translators, because GNU gettext provides\r\nthe 'msgmerge' program, which prepares a message catalog before a\r\ntranslation update.\r\n\r\nUsers of GNU packages should also install GNU gettext because some\r\nother GNU packages will use the gettext program included in this\r\npackage to internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe homepage of this package is at\r\n\r\n           http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/\r\n\r\nThe primary FTP site for its distribution is\r\n\r\n           ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/\r\n\r\n\r\nSend comments and bug reports to\r\n                bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThe configure script provides a non-standard option.  It is also\r\navailable in other packages that use the functionality of GNU gettext.\r\nUse\r\n\r\n        --disable-nls\r\n\r\nif you absolutely don't want to have messages handling code.  You will\r\nalways get the original messages (mostly English).  You could consider\r\nusing NLS support even when you do not need other tongues.  If you do\r\nnot install any messages catalogs or do not specify to use another but\r\nthe C locale you will not get translations.\r\n\r\nThe set of languages for which catalogs should be installed can also be\r\nspecified while configuring.  Of course they must be available but the\r\nintersection of these two sets are computed automatically.  You could\r\nonce and for all define in your profile/cshrc the variable LINGUAS:\r\n\r\n(Bourne Shell)          LINGUAS=\"de fr nl\"; export LINGUAS\r\n\r\n(C Shell)               setenv LINGUAS \"de fr nl\"\r\n\r\nor specify it directly while configuring\r\n\r\n        env LINGUAS=\"de fr nl\" ./configure\r\n\r\nConsult the manual for more information on language names.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther files you might look into:\r\n\r\nABOUT-NLS    - current state of the GNU internationalization effort\r\nCOPYING      - copying conditions\r\nDEPENDENCIES - list of prerequisite packages, to be installed before this one\r\nINSTALL      - general compilation and installation rules\r\nNEWS         - major changes in the current version\r\nTHANKS       - list of contributors\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
